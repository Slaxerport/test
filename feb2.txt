- Tell me, uncle, itâ€™s not without reason
Moscow, burned by fire,
Given to the Frenchman?
After all, there were battles,
Yes, they say, even more!
No wonder all of Russia remembers
About Borodin Day!
- Yes, there were people in our time,
Not like the current tribe:
The heroes are not you!
They got a bad lot:
Few returned from the field...
If it weren't God's will,
They wouldn't give up Moscow!
